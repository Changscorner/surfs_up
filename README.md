- In June the temperature averaged around 74.9F with the lows around 64F and high around 85F while for December the average temperature was around 71F with the lows around 56F and the high at 83F.
- Around 50% of the daily temperature in June was around 75F while in December it was at 71F.
- The standard deviation of temperature in December is approximately 0.75 higher than in June which accounts for the larger range in temperatures in the first and third quartile.


### Summary

The difference in standard deviation from close to the peak during summer and the cold months during the winter is not as large as one would think. 
With the STD being around only 0.75 between the two months and the max temperature having a difference of only 2 degrees F.
With this information we can make a reasonable conclusion that an ice cream and surf business would definitely be viable year round in Hawaii.
